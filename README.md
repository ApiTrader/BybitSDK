# ByBit Integration

The code in this directory is an sdk for interacting with the bybit platform using Python.

## Installation

Personally, I choose to use an anaconda environment with Python 3.6+. With a fresh environment you should be able to install the environment with the following pip command. 
```
pip install git+https://github.com/ApiTrader/BybitSDK.git@master
```

## Getting started

The following is a code snippet to create the client object and make a Get request. Please note that our client class has access to all of the subclass functions in our sdk library.  
```python
from bybit_sdk.bybit_client import ByBitClient

# set required variables
base_url = 'https://api-testnet.bybit.com/'
api_key = '<YOUR API KEY>'
api_secret = '<YOUR API SECRET>' # required parameter but if you use open endpoints then we do not check them
web_socket_url = '<WEB_SOCKET_URL>' # Websocket Url is an optional parameter only needed for web socket data. 

# create platform client
client = ByBitClient(base_url=base_url, api_key=api_key, api_secret=api_secret, web_socket_url=web_socket_url)


client.get_symbol_data()
```

Funding
- [Funding rate](bybit_funding.py)
    - Funding rate is generated every 8 hours at 00:00 UTC, 08:00 UTC and 16:00 UTC. If it's 12:00 UTC now, what you will get is the funding rate generated at 08:00 UTC.
- [My funding fee](bybit_funding.py)
    - Users last funding fee. The current interval's fund fee settlement is based on the previous interval's fund rate. For example, at 16:00, the settlement is based on the fund rate generated at 8:00. The fund rate generated at 16:00 will be used at 0:00 on the next day.
- [Predicted funding](bybit_funding.py)
    - Gets the predicted funding rate for the next settlement period. 
    - When the funding rate is positive, long positions pay short positions and if it is negative, the short position holders have to pay the long position holders. If you close your position before the Funding interval, you will not be charged. This means it may be good to exit before this funding fee. 
    - funding fee = position value*funding rate. Position value = quantity of contract/mark price.
